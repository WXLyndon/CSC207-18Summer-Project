Jie Wang 1002287651: Design and write basic structure. Add Observable and dependency injection design pattern. Add one
major feature (Shortest distant between tow point of overlapping transit system, achieved by bfs). Add demo method which
demos the case that transfer does not happen because the first trip is over 2 hours.

Qizheng Wang 1002079877:
wrote TravelCard including start new trip and end trip(the transfer problem and $6 cap).
wrote log.txt related method in AdminInfo
wrote all GUI(Controllers and Viewers) expect UserStage.showPieChart and AdminStage.showBarChart

Xuanlin Wang 1002172463:
Implement Singleton design pattern to TransInfo class to store all the needed info like AdminInfo and UserList instances,
and make it implements Serializable to store it, and reload it when the program restarts.
Add another major statistical features to show pie chart and show bar chart related to the AdminUsers' monthly report(
all stations reached and revenue each day) and Cardholders' report(3O Recent Recent Trips' Types).
Fix all style warnings and typos and rearrange the design and format..
